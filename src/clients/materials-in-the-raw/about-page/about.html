            <h2>Our history</h2>
            <p>
                Materials In The Raw was established at Casula in 1988 as a bulk
                materials distributor reselling sand, soil, gravel and mulches.
                Since that time the business has grown through acquisition of
                other similar businesses and the commencement of new outlets in
                strategic locations.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result the outlets all differ in size and layout however
                the common characteristics include high exposure locations, ease
                of access, well presented displays of major product lines,
                competent and experienced staff and seven day operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Chullora branch is the latest development of Materials In
                The Raw that demonstrates the presentation of product and
                shoplines whilst Posh Paving within the Gladesville branch
                clearly establishes Materials In The Raw as the innovative
                leader within the retail and trade markets in Sydney.
            </p>

            <p>
                Materials In The Raw provides landscape solutions for the urban
                environment. The recent urban consolidation growth that has
                occurred in the metropolitan Sydney area has necessitated the
                development of innovative landscape materials to ensure the
                preservation of outdoor living in reduced courtyards and
                landscape settings.

            </p>

            <p>
                Retail customers typically comprise home owners' and DIY
                customers who have been strongly influenced by the popularity of
                backyard and landscape lifestyle promotions.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result of the strategic location of the branches Materials
                In The Raw is well positioned to continue to experience growth

            <h2>Business growth plan</h2>
            <p>
                As a result of the NSW Government policy of urban consolidation
                it is considered that Materials In The Raw will enjoy
                significant growth of its business. The Government is promoting
                increased density of residential living in inner Sydney and
                around the major population centres which encourage the
                construction of town houses, units and smaller residential
                blocks.
            </p>

            <p>
                The construction industry and its associated tradesmen and
                residents create continued demand for the products supplied by
                Materials In The Raw. Strategically Materials In The Raw have
                situated branches at the centres of growth in urban
                consolidation in Sydney, Bankstown, Liverpool, Parramatta,
                Campbelltown and Penrith and the business will benefit from
                these opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within the Sydney area the environmental requirements and the
                shortage of high exposure sites will enhance the growth of the
                business over competitors who have inferior locations and cannot
                buy under the favourable terms enjoyed by Materials In The Raw.
                The business is uniquely placed to be cost effective in the
                market as the proprietor is a well established wholesaler with
                renown quarrying and recycling expertise.
            </p>

            <p>
                Materials In The Raw have adopted innovative and aggressive
                strategies to dominate the paving and masonry block wall markets
                that will continue to strengthen the business position overall
                and ensure the future relationships with product suppliers are
                underwritten to benefit from dealing with a multiple outlet
                business in lieu of smaller operators.

                Materials In The Raw have installed a management information
                system that controls the predominantly cash operation and credit
                accounts. The Pronto Management System is located at head office
                and is connected to all the branches via the internet. This

                managed and maintained at head office.
            </p>

            <p>
                The system resides on the head office server which controls the

                and general ledger. It is an integrated system comprising
                different modules that are all proprietary items. The system

                reporting together with profit and loss statements and balance
