        >History of Materials In The Raw</span
    >
</h3>
<p>
    Materials In The Raw was established at Casula in 1988 as a bulk materials
    distributor reselling sand, soil, gravel and mulches. Since that time the
    business has grown through acquisition of other similar businesses and the
    commencement of new outlets in strategic locations.
</p>
<p>
    As a result the outlets all differ in size and layout however the common
    characteristics include high exposure locations, ease of access, well
    presented displays of major product lines, competent and experienced staff
    and seven day operation.
</p>
<p>
    The Chullora branch is the latest development of Materials In The Raw that
    demonstrates the presentation of product and shoplines whilst Posh Paving
    within the Gladesville branch clearly establishes Materials In The Raw as
    the innovative leader within the retail and trade markets in Sydney.
</p>
<p>
    Materials In The Raw provides landscape solutions for the urban environment.
    The recent urban consolidation growth that has occurred in the metropolitan
    Sydney area has necessitated the development of innovative landscape
    materials to ensure the preservation of outdoor living in reduced courtyards
    and landscape settings.

        >Business Growth Plan</span
    >
</h3>
<p>
    As a result of the NSW Government policy of urban consolidation it is
    considered that Materials In The Raw will enjoy significant growth of its
    business. The Government is promoting increased density of residential
    living in inner Sydney and around the major population centres which
    encourage the construction of town houses, units and smaller residential
    blocks.
</p>
<p>
    The construction industry and its associated tradesmen and residents create
    continued demand for the products supplied by Materials In The Raw.
    Strategically Materials In The Raw have situated branches at the centres of
    growth in urban consolidation in Sydney, Bankstown, Liverpool, Parramatta,
    Campbelltown and Penrith and the business will benefit from these
    opportunities.
</p>
<p>
    Within the Sydney area the environmental requirements and the shortage of
    high exposure sites will enhance the growth of the business over competitors
    who have inferior locations and cannot buy under the favourable terms
    enjoyed by Materials In The Raw. The business is uniquely placed to be cost
    effective in the market as the proprietor is a well established wholesaler
    with renown quarrying and recycling expertise.
</p>
<p>
    Materials In The Raw have adopted innovative and aggressive strategies to
    dominate the paving and masonry block wall markets that will continue to
    strengthen the business position overall and ensure the future relationships
    with product suppliers are underwritten to benefit from dealing with a
    multiple outlet business in lieu of smaller operators.
