    Divi is a popular WordPress theme that allows users to easily create
    visually stunning websites without the need for extensive coding knowledge.
    However, as with any website, there may come a time when you need to make
    content changes to your Divi-built page. Here are some steps to follow to
    make content changes to a page built with Divi:

/>

<p>
    Login to your WordPress dashboard. You can login to your dashboard through
    the following link: <code>domain.com</code>, replacing
    <code>domain.com</code> with your website domain. For example, for us to
    login to the back end of our website, we would enter
    <code>cogbranding.com.au/wp-admin/</code>.

    alt="WordPress pages image"
/>

<p>
    Once you are logged in to the back end, navigate to pages then select the
    desired Divi built page you wish to edit.

    alt=""
/>

<p>
    Next, once the page has loaded, you can click the "Build on the front end"
    button which will load a preview of the page allowing you to make visual
    changes.
    <strong
        >Do not click the "Return to standard editor" button, this will result
        in the page reverting to a default WordPress page, and as a result, all
        Divi built content will be removed.</strong
    >

    alt=""
/>

<p>
    You are now able to make changes to the page, to edit specific content, you
    can hover (or click - depending on your settings) on the content you wish to
    edit, then click the gear icon to bring up the settings panel for that
    element.
</p>

<p>
    In the settings panel, you can edit the content, style, and layout of the
    element.

/>

<p>
    Once you are happy with your changes, you can "Save" to apply them to a
    page. There are two options to save as seen in the image above. The "Exit
    visual builder" will save your changes and return you to the back end of the
    page, whereas the "Save" in the bottom right will save the page without
    closing the page builder you're currently in.
</p>

<h4>Important note</h4>

<p>
    It's important to note that while Divi's drag-and-drop builder makes it easy
    to make content changes, it's still important to have a basic understanding
    of web design principles and best practices. Making changes without careful
    consideratino could negatively impact the user experience or even break the
    page. Take the time to review your changes and make sure they enhance the
    overhhall look and functionality of the page.
