    WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) that powers millions
    of websites worldwide. If you're new to WordPress, it can seem overwhelming
    at first. However, with a little guidance, you'll quickly find that
    WordPress is easy to use and highly customizable. Here's a general user
    guide to help you get started:
</p>

<h4>Quick overview</h4>

<p>
    Before going in-depth with each part of the back end, the below information
    will give you a quick overview of what you see when first logging in to the
    back end of your website.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        You can login to your dashboard through the following link:
        <code>domain.com</code>, replacing <code>domain.com</code> with your
        website domain. For example, for us to login to the back end of our
        website, we would enter <code>cogbranding.com.au/wp-admin/</code>.
    </li>

    <li>
        Dashboard: The dashboard is the first page you'll see after logging in.
        It provides an overview of your website's activity and allows you to
        access various areas of your site.
    </li>

    <li>
        Posts vs. Pages: Posts are typically used for blog entries and are
        displayed in reverse chronological order. Pages, on the other hand, are
        used for static content like your About Us or Contact pages.
    </li>

    <li>
        Adding content: To add a new post or page, go to the "Posts" or "Pages"
        section of the dashboard and click "Add New." From here, you can add
        text, images, and other media to your content. Please view our

        to make changes to a website built by us.
    </li>

    <li>
        Themes: WordPress allows you to change the look and feel of your site
        using themes. To change your theme, go to the "Appearance" section of
        the dashboard and click "Themes." Here, you can browse through thousands
        of free and premium themes.
    </li>

    <li>
        Plugins: Plugins are like apps for your WordPress site. They can add new
        features, improve performance, and enhance your site's functionality. To
        add a new plugin, go to the "Plugins" section of the dashboard and click
        "Add New." While plugins add a lot of functionality easily, it's good to
        note that adding a lot of plugins to your website will slow it down and
        impact its performance.
    </li>

    <li>
        Settings: The "Settings" section of the dashboard allows you to
        configure various settings for your site, such as your site title and
        tagline, permalink structure, and more.
    </li>

    <li>
        Users: The "Users" section of the dashboard allows you to manage user
        accounts for your site, including adding new users, editing user roles
        and permissions, and deleting users.
    </li>

    <li>
        Updates: WordPress releases regular updates to improve security, fix
        bugs, and add new features. Be sure to keep your site updated by
        regularly checking for updates in the "Updates" section of the
        dashboard.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    These are just a few of the basics of using WordPress. As you become more
    familiar with the platform, you'll discover a wealth of additional features
    and customization options. With a little practice and experimentation,
    you'll be able to create a stunning, fully functional website using
    WordPress.
