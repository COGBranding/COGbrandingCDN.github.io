                Junior activities programme called Nippers introduces surf
                lifesaving to kids aged from 5 and 14. It's a great initiative
                that allows Children to meet new people, get exercise, and learn
                how to enjoy the beach safely. Nippers will teach children surf
                awareness and safety, receive instruction in wading, running,
                ocean swimming, board paddling, lifesaving techniques, as well
                as the fundamentals of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first
                aid, as they go through the various age levels. Nippers
                generally meets on a Sunday morning from October to March,
                though this might vary from club to club, so check with your
                local club for specifics.
