# Divi context options

When exported, Divi's pages will show the context they have been exported in. The most common contexts are the following.

```
"context":"et_builder"
"context":"et_theme_builder"
"context":"et_builder_layouts"
```

### Context options

You will need to import the file in the same context as it was exported.

“et_builder_layouts” – Exported from the Divi Library
“et_builder” – Exported from the Divi Builder
“et_theme_builder” – Exported from the Theme Builder
